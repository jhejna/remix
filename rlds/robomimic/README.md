# Robomimic Dataset

A simple example for creating RLDS datasets using the robot-lightning package. This is taken from the [RLDS builder repo](https://github.com/kpertsch/rlds_dataset_builder) by Karl Pertsch.

To build the dataset, `cd` into its folder then run `tfds build --data_dir /path/to/dataset/output`.

Make sure to edit the paths in `robomimic_dataset_builder.py` to be correct.
